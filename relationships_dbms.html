                In database management systems (DBMS), different types of relationships refer to how data across tables are connected and structured. Here are the key types:
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>One-to-One</b>
                <br>
                Each record in the first table is related to exactly one record in the second table, and vice versa. This type of relationship is uncommon due to its restrictive nature.

            </p>
            <br>
            <hr style="color: aliceblue">
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>
                    One-to-Many
                </b>
                <br>
                A single record in the first table can relate to multiple records in the second table, but each record in the second table can only be related to one record in the first table.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr style="color: aliceblue">
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Many-to-One
                </b>
                <br>
                Multiple records in the first table can be related to a single record in the second table. This is essentially the inverse of a One-to-Many relationship.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr style="color: aliceblue">
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Many-to-Many</b>
                <br>
                Multiple records in the first table can be related to multiple records in the second table, and vice versa. This relationship type typically requires a junction (or associative) table to facilitate the connection.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr style="color: aliceblue">
            <br>
            <p>
                Understanding these relationship types is crucial for designing efficient and normalized databases that accurately reflect the relationships between different entities or data points.
