                <b> STEPS TO CREATE GMAIL ACCOUNT</b>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visit Gmail: Go to the Gmail website (www.gmail.com).</li>
                    <li>Click on "Create account": You'll usually find this option near the bottom of the page, but it might be at the top depending on the layout.</li>
                <li>Fill out the form: Enter your first and last name in the provided fields. Choose a username for your Gmail address. This username will be followed by "@gmail.com". If your preferred username is not available, Gmail will suggest alternatives or you can try a different one.</li>
            <li>Create a password: Choose a strong password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. This helps secure your account. Gmail will ask you to enter the password twice to ensure you typed it correctly.</li>    
        <li>Add and verify your phone number: This step is optional but highly recommended. Adding a recovery phone number makes it easier to recover your account if you forget your password. Gmail will send a verification code to the phone number you provide. Enter this code to verify your number.</li>    
    <li>Add and verify your email address: Again, this step is optional but can help with account recovery. If you have another email address, you can add it and verify it.</li>    
<li>Complete the CAPTCHA: This is to confirm that you're a real person and not a bot trying to create multiple accounts.</li>    
<li>Agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy: Read these documents and, if you agree, click on "I agree" or "Next".</li>
<li>Your account is created: Once you've completed these steps, your Gmail account is ready to use. You can access it by signing in with your username (your Gmail address) and password.</li>
</ol>
<br>
That's it! You've successfully created your Gmail account. Now you can start sending and receiving emails.

                <b>STEPS TO CONNECT VS CODE TO GITHUB</b>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Install Git: Before you can connect VSCode to GitHub, ensure Git is installed on your computer. You can download Git from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</li>
                    <li>Install Visual Studio Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from code.visualstudio.com.</li>
                    <li>Open VSCode: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Open or Create a Project: Open an existing project or create a new one in VSCode. The project should be stored locally on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Initialize Git Repository: If your project is not already a Git repository, initialize Git by opening a terminal in VSCode (press Ctrl + on Windows/Linux or Cmd + on macOS) and run the following command in the root directory of your project:<br>
                        git init
                    </li>
                    <li>Stage and Commit Changes: Make changes to your project files and stage them for commit using Git commands in the terminal. For example:<br>
                        git add . <br>
                        git commit -m "Initial commit"
                        </li>
                    <li>Connect to GitHub:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a GitHub Repository: Go to github.com and log in to your GitHub account. Create a new repository (repo) by clicking on the "+" sign in the upper right corner and selecting "New repository".</li>
                            <li>Link Local Repository to GitHub Repository:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In VSCode, open the Command Palette (press Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS).</li>
                                    <li>Type and select "Git: Add Remote".</li>
                                    <li>Enter the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git). Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of your repository.</li>
                                    <li>Press Enter to confirm.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Push to GitHub: After linking your local repository to the GitHub repository, push your changes from VSCode to GitHub:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open the Command Palette again (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS).</li>
                            <li>Type and select "Git: Push".</li>
                            <li>Choose the remote repository (GitHub) where you want to push your changes.</li>
                            <li>Enter your GitHub credentials if prompted.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Verify on GitHub: Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes have been pushed successfully.</li>
                </ol><br>
                By following these steps, you can effectively connect Visual Studio Code to GitHub, enabling seamless version control and collaboration for your projects.

                <b>STEPS TO PUBLISH REPO AS LIVE SITE</b>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> Prepare Your Repository: <br>
                        Ensure your repository contains all necessary files and configurations for your static website:
                    <ul>
                     <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Include all HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and any other assets (images, fonts, etc.) required for your site.</li>
                     <li>Branch: Make sure your repository is on the branch (often main or master) that you want to deploy from.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Enable GitHub Pages:<br>
                    GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Here’s how to enable it:
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to Repository Settings:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.</li>
                            <li>Click on the "Settings" tab located near the top-right of the repository.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Settings page, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
                    <li>Under "Source", you'll see a dropdown menu. Select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., main or master).</li>
                    <li>GitHub Pages will automatically save your selection. It will also provide you with the URL where your site will be published (e.g., https://username.github.io/repository).</li>

                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Verify and Deploy:<br>
                    After enabling GitHub Pages and configuring your domain (if applicable), GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. It may take a few minutes for the initial deployment to complete.
                    <uL>
                        <li>Once deployed, access your live site using the URL provided in the GitHub Pages section of your repository settings (or your custom domain if configured).</li>
                        <li>Whenever you push changes to the selected branch of your repository, GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and update your site. You can verify your changes by revisiting the site URL.</li>
                    </uL>
                </li>
                </ol><br>
                By following these steps, you can easily publish your repository as a live site using GitHub Pages, making your static website accessible to anyone on the internet.
