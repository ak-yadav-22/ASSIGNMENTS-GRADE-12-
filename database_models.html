                <b>Hierarchical Database Model:<br></b>
                In a hierarchical database model, data is organized in a tree-like structure where each record type has a single parent record type and multiple child record types. The parent-child relationship represents a one-to-many relationship. It was popular in early databases, particularly mainframe environments, and is efficient for certain types of data with clear hierarchical relationships.

                <b>Network Database Model:<br></b>
                The network database model extends the hierarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships between records. It uses a graph structure where nodes represent records and edges represent relationships. This model was developed to address some limitations of the hierarchical model, offering more flexibility and allowing complex relationships between data.

                <b>Relational Database Model:<br></b>
                The relational database model organizes data into tables (or relations) where each table consists of rows (or tuples) and columns (or attributes). Relationships between tables are established through keys. This model, introduced by E.F. Codd, is based on set theory and predicate logic, offering a flexible and powerful way to manage structured data. It is widely used in modern database management systems (DBMS).

                    Object-Oriented Database Model: <br>
                </b>
                In the object-oriented database model, data is represented as objects, similar to object-oriented programming concepts. These objects can encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). This model allows complex data structures to be represented more naturally than in relational databases, making it suitable for applications where data has rich, interconnected structures. It combines principles from object-oriented programming with database capabilities.

            Each of these database models has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of applications and data management scenarios.
